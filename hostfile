## This is the default hostfile for Open MPI.  Notice that it does not
## contain any hosts (not even localhost).  This file should only
## contain hosts if a system administrator wants users to always have
## the same set of default hosts, and is not using a batch scheduler
## (such as SLURM, PBS, etc.).
##
## Note that this file is *not* used when running in "managed"
## environments (e.g., running in a job under a job scheduler, such as
## SLURM or PBS / Torque).
##
## If you are primarily interested in running Open MPI on one node, you
## should *not* simply list "localhost" in here (contrary to prior MPI
## implementations, such as LAM/MPI).  A localhost-only node list is
## created by the RAS component named "localhost" if no other RAS
## components were able to find any hosts to run on (this behavior can
## be disabled by excluding the localhost RAS component by specifying
## the value "^localhost" [without the quotes] to the "ras" MCA
## parameter).
